#+TITLE: Yuzu Linux Downloader

Presently (Spring 2020) there is no linux installer for Yuzu. Unfortunately, the =earlyaccess= channel is only available via the installer. Meaning that in order to get an early access version of the emulator you first need to download the source onto a windows virtual machine, to be built on your linux machine.

This script removes the requirement of using the installer. It downloads the windows version directly from https://api.yuzu-emu.org/, patches it to be compatible with linux, and builds it in a user defined directory.

Note, in order to access the =earlyaccess= branch follow the instructions on https://yuzu-emu.org/help/early-access/

** Usage
Before running the script make sure it has permission to execute.

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
chmod +x ./yuzu-early-access.sh
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
./yuzu-linux-downloader.sh [-c CHANNEL ] [-d DIRECTORY] LOGIN_TOKEN
#+END_SRC

- Get your =LOGIN_TOKEN= from https://profile.yuzu-emu.org/

Currently the only =CHANNEL= is =earlyaccess=, others can be added in the future. I just don't know their api endpoints.

=DIRECTORY= is where the yuzu program will be downloaded and compiled. It Defaults to pwd.

Once installed yuzu can be run via =./$DIRECTORY/$BUILDNAME/build/bin/yuzu=. =BUILDNAME= is dictated by https://api.yuzu-emu.org/

** Future Development
- Implement the mainline and canary channels
- Ask user if they want to download if the file already exists
- Modify to allow for easy automation (check for update every 24 hours and build)

The following can be used to get the latest release browser download for main line.
#+BEGIN_SRC: bash
curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/yuzu-emu/yuzu-mainline/releases/latest" \
|grep "linux-.*xz" \
| tail -1 \
| awk -F ": " '{print $2}' \
| sed 's/\"//g'\
#+END_SRC
